## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

 Tiktok

Direct messaging and sharing features through different apps like messages and instagram

Pinterest

I like how you can create multiple vision boards with different themes 

I enjoy how the pictures are catered based off of what I have previously interacted with

Zen Color

I love the calming music that plays in the background as I color

My favorite activity to do is to color the picture of the day 

I love how you can choose to color by number or skip around

My App Idea

App Name: ClimbConnect

I want this app to connect users that enjoy climbing to find climbing routes nearby which have information such as difficulty levels, types of walls, and reviews. There can be features such as climb checklists to customize certain gear you need for each climb and training logs to time how long users climb for. I want it to be a sharing/interactive app where users can post about different climbs and find a supportive community to share and bond with. 


## Notes


Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I struggled with connecting XCode to github and I also had a bit of trouble navigating the XCode app as well. Otherwise, I believe I was able to follow the instructions successfully.
